The repository contains methods for the preprocessing of transcriptomics datasets deriving from DNA microarray and RNA Sequencing experiments. 

For DNA microarray preprocessing, we provide pipelines useful to analyse both Agilent and Affymetrix data. Moreover, we provide scripts to harmonise the meta-data table related to transcriptomics data. 

On the other hand, for RNA-Seq data the pipeline allows a thorough preprocessing of the data, assisting the user in every step, starting from the read alignment and alignment to counts normalisation.
